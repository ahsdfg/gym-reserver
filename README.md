# gym-reserver
gym reservation automation by python tkinter and selenium.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the university gym implemented a reservation system, which many students, including my friends, found inconvenient as it required them to reserve specific times for their workouts. 
Meanwhile, I was delving into web scraping techniques as part of my data science studies and realized I could create a program to automate the reservation process. 
After further research, I learned that such a program would require a web driver, and I found that Selenium was suitable for this task. 
Additionally, having already studied the tkinter library for creating Graphical User Interfaces during a Python course on YouTube, I decided to utilize my knowledge to develop a gym reservation program. 
This project is the culmination of my efforts in these areas.
